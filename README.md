# Decision Trees on Pokémon Mega Evolution Dataset

## Overview
This project applies decision tree classification to predict Mega Evolution status for Pokémon based on their attributes, using Python. It demonstrates supervised machine learning concepts—including tree building, model tuning, and feature analysis—on a real-world, fan-interest dataset.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and handling for the Pokémon Mega Evolution dataset
- Implementation of decision tree classifier from scikit-learn
- Visualization of decision boundaries and tree structure
- Analysis of attribute importance and prediction accuracy
- Step-by-step code documentation and result interpretation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/venkatbhaskar4u/Decision-trees-implementation-on-Pokemon-MegaEvolution-Dataset.git`
2. Open `Decision_Trees_Pokemon.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to process the dataset, train the decision tree, and view model results.

## Results & Example Outputs
- Achieves 90% classification accuracy for Mega Evolution status
- Displays feature importance rankings and a visualized decision tree plot
- Sample output:
Pokémon: Charizard, Mega Evolution: Yes (Predicted)

## How Decision Trees Work (Simplified)
Decision trees split data into branches based on feature values, creating a flowchart-like structure for prediction. At each split, the tree chooses the attribute that best separates the data (using metrics like Gini impurity or entropy), ultimately leading to a decision (e.g., “Mega” or “Not Mega”).
